    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "Regression is the process of predicting a continuous value. In regression, there are two types of variables, a dependent variable, and one or more independent variables. The dependent variable, can be seen as the state, target, or final goal we study, and try to predict, and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be seen as the causes of those states. The independent variables are shown conventionally by X, and the dependent variable is notated by Y. Our regression model relates Y, or the dependent variable, to a function of X i.e. The independent variables. The key point in the regression, is that our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a discrete value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, there are two types of regression models. Simple regression, and multiple regression. Simple regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable. It can be either linear, or non-linear.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When more than one independent variable is present, the processes is called multiple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variables. In simple linear regression, there are two variables, a dependent variable and an independent variable. The key point in the linear regression is that our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a discrete value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple linear regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable.\n",
    "* When more than one independent variable is present the process is called multiple linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "With linear regression you can fit a line through the data. For instance, as the engine size increases, so do the emissions. With linear regression you can model the relationship of these variables. A good model can be used to predict what the approximate emission of each car is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fit line is shown traditionally as a polynomial. In a simple regression problem  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\hat{y} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1$  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $\\hat{y}$ is the dependent variable or the predicted value. And $x_1$ is the independent variable. $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ are the parameters of the line that we must adjust. \n",
    "* $\\theta_1$ is known as the slope or gradient of the fitting line\n",
    "* $\\theta_0$ is known as the intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ are also called the coefficients of the linear equation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you compare the actual value of the emission of the car with what we've predicted using our model, you will find out that we have a error. This means our prediction line is not accurate. This error is also called the residual error. The mean of all residual errors shows how poorly the line fits with the whole data set. Mathematically it can be shown by the equation Mean Squared Error, shown as MSE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i-\\hat{y_i})^2}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to find a line where the mean of all these errors is minimized. In other words, the mean error of the prediction using the fit line should be minimized. we have two options here. Options are:\n",
    "1. use a mathematic approach \n",
    "2. use an optimization approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "for Option 1:  \n",
    "$ \\theta_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{(x_i-\\overline{x})(y_i-\\overline{y})}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{s}{(x_i-\\overline{x})^2}}$  \n",

    "### Model evaluation in Regression Models\n",
    "The goal of regression is to build a model to accurately predict an unknown case. To this end, we have to perform regression evaluation after building the model.  \n",
    "How can we calculate the accuracy of our model? In other words, how much can we trust this model for prediction of an unknown sample using a given dataset and having built a model such as linear regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train and test on the same dataset:  \n",
    "    Select a portion of our dataset for testing. For instance, assume that we have 10 records in our dataset. We use the entire dataset for training, and we build a model using this training set. Now, we select a small portion of the dataset. This set is called a test set, which has actual value, but they are not used for prediction and is used only as ground truth. Now we pass the feature set of the testing portion to our built model and predict the target values. Finally, we compare the predicted values by our model with the actual values in the test set. Finally, we compare the predicted values by our model with the actual values in the test set. There are different metrics to report the accuracy of the mode (see next chapter).  \n",
    "    This evaluation approach would most likely have a **high training accuracy** and the **low out-of-sample accuracy** since the model knows all of the testing data points from the training.\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Training accuracy** is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes when using the test dataset. However, \n",
    "* a high training accuracy may result in an over-fit the data. This means that the model is overly trained to the dataset, which may capture noise and produce a non-generalized model. \n",
    "**Out-of-sample accuracy** is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that the model has not been trained on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Doing a train and test on the same dataset will most likely have low out-of-sample accuracy due to the likelihood of being over-fit. It's important that our models have high out-of-sample accuracy because the purpose of our model is, of course, to make correct predictions on unknown data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train/test split\n",
    "In this approach, we select a portion of our dataset for training, and the rest is used for testing. The model is built on the training set. Then, the test feature set is passed to the model for prediction. Finally, the predicted values for the test set are compared with the actual values of the testing set. The second evaluation approach is called train/test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train/test split involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are **mutually exclusive**. After which, you train with the training set and test with the testing set. It is more realistic for real-world problems. This means that we know the outcome of each data point in the dataset.\n",
    "The issue with train/test split is that it's highly dependent on the datasets on which the data was trained and tested. The variation of this causes train/test split to have a better out-of-sample prediction than training and testing on the same dataset, but it still has some problems due to this dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-fold Cross validation\n",
    "K-fold cross-validation, resolves most of the above issues. It fixes a high variation that results from a dependency by averaging it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have K equals four folds, then we split up this dataset as shown here. \n",
    "1. In the first fold for example, we use the first 25 percent of the dataset for testing and the rest for training. The model is built using the training set and is evaluated using the test set. \n",
    "2. Then, in the next round or in the second fold, the second 25 percent of the dataset is used for testing and the rest for training the model. Again, the accuracy of the model is calculated. \n",
    "3. We continue for all folds. \n",
    "4. Finally, the result of all four evaluations are averaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics in Regression Models\n",
    "Evaluation metrics are used to explain the performance of a model. Evaluation metrics, provide a key role in the development of a model, as it provides insight to areas that require improvement. \n",
    "Model evaluation metrics includs elements such as\n",
    "* mean absolute error, \n",
    "* mean squared error, \n",
    "* root mean squared error.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Definition of error:\n",
    "In the context of regression, the error of the model is the difference between the data points and the trend line generated by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "$y$ = actual labels or values  \n",
    "$\\hat{y}$ = predicted labels or value\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean absolute error (MAE)** is the mean of the absolute value of the errors.  \n",
    "    $MAE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n{|y_j-\\hat{y}_j|}$  \n",
    "    This is the easiest of the metrics to understand, since it's just the average error. \n",
    "2. **Mean squared error (MSE)** is the mean of the squared error.  \n",
    "    $MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n{(y_j-\\hat{y}_j)^2}$  \n",
    "    It's more popular because the focus is geared more towards large errors. This is due to the squared term exponentially increasing larger errors in comparison to smaller ones. \n",
    "3. **Root mean squared error (RMSE)** is the square root of the mean squared error.  \n",
    "    $RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n{(y_j-\\hat{y}_j)^2}}$  \n",
    "    This is most popular form of the evaluation metrics because root mean squared error is interpretable in the same units as the response vector or y units, making it easy to relate its information. \n",
    "4. **Relative absolute error (RAE)**,   \n",
    "    $RAE = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^n{|y_j-\\hat{y}_j|}}{\\sum_{j=1}^n{|y_j-\\overline{y}_j|}}$  \n",
    "    also known as residual sum of square, where $\\overline{y}$ is a mean value of y, takes the total absolute error and normalizes it by dividing by the total absolute error of the simple predictor. \n",
    "5. **Relative squared error (RSE)**  \n",
    "    $RSE = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^n{(y_j-\\hat{y}_j)^2}}{\\sum_{j=1}^n{(y_j-\\overline{y}_j)^2}}$  \n",
    "    is very similar to relative absolute error but is widely adopted by the data science community, as it is used for calculating ($R^2$). \n",
    "6. R squared ($R^2$)  \n",
    "    ($R^2 = 1 - RSE$)  \n",
    "    is not an error per se but it represents how close the data values are to the fitted regression line. The higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "When multiple independent variables are present, the process is called multiple linear regression. Multiple linear regression is the extension of the simple linear regression model.\n",
    "Basically, there are two applications for multiple linear regression. \n",
    "* First, it can be used when we would like to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on the dependent variable. \n",
    "* Second, it can be used to predict the impact of changes, that is, to understand how the dependent variable changes when we change the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression is a method of predicting a continuous variable. It uses multiple variables called independent variables or predictors that best predict the value of the target variable which is also called the dependent variable. In multiple linear regression, the target value Y, is a linear combination of independent variables X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the model is of the form  \n",
    "$ \\hat{y} = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x_1 + ... + \\theta_n x_n$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we can show it as a vector form as well. This means it can be shown as a dot product of two vectors;  \n",
    "$ \\hat{y} = \\theta^T X$  \n",
    "$ \\theta^T = [\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2, ...]$ $ X = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 \\\\\n",
    "x_1 \\\\\n",
    "x_2\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters vector and the feature set vector. Generally, we can show the equation for a multidimensional space as theta transpose x, where theta is an n by one vector of unknown parameters in a multi-dimensional space, and x is the vector of the featured sets, as theta is a vector of coefficients and is supposed to be multiplied by x. Conventionally, it is shown as transpose theta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element of the feature set would be set to one, because it turns that theta zero into the intercept or biased parameter when the vector is multiplied by the parameter vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea is to find the best fit hyperplane for our data. To this end and as is the case in linear regression, we should estimate the values for theta vector that best predict the value of the target field in each row. To achieve this goal, we have to minimize the error of the prediction. Optimized parameters are the ones which lead to a model with the fewest errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean of all residual errors shows how bad the model is representing the data set, it is called the mean squared error, or MSE. The objective of multiple linear regression is to minimize the MSE equation. To minimize it, we should find the best parameters $\\theta$. The most common methods are the **ordinary least squares** and **optimization approach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ordinary least squares** tries to estimate the values of the coefficients by minimizing the mean square error. This approach uses the data as a matrix and uses linear algebra operations to estimate the optimal values for the theta. The problem with this technique is the time complexity of calculating matrix operations as it can take a very long time to finish. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimization algorithm** to find the best parameters. That is, you can use a process of optimizing the values of the coefficients by iteratively minimizing the error of the model on your training data. For example, you can use gradient descent which starts optimization with random values for each coefficient, then calculates the errors and tries to minimize it through y's changing of the coefficients in multiple iterations. Gradient descent is a proper approach if you have a large data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we found the parameters of the linear equation, making predictions is as simple as solving the equation for a specific set of inputs. Multiple linear regression **estimates the relative importance of predictors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges:\n",
    "1. Adding too many independent variables without any theoretical justification may result in an overfit model. An overfit model is a real problem because it is too complicated for your data set and not general enough to be used for prediction. So, it is recommended to avoid using many variables for prediction.\n",
    "2. Should independent variables be continuous? Basically, categorical independent variables can be incorporated into a regression model by converting them into numerical variables. There needs to be a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each of your independent variables. If the relationship displayed in your scatter plot is not linear, then you need to use non-linear regression.\n",

    "You can see a quadratic and cubic regression lines here, and it can go on and on to infinite degrees. In essence, we can call all of these polynomial regression, where the relationship between the independent variable X and the dependent variable Y is modeled as an Nth degree polynomial in X.

Decision trees are about testing an attribute and branching the cases based on the result of the test. Each internal node corresponds to a test, and each branch corresponds to a result of the test, and each leaf node assigns a patient to a class.  \n",
    "A decision tree can be constructed by considering the attributes one by one. First, choose an attribute from our dataset. Calculate the significance of the attribute in the splitting of the data. Next, split the data based on the value of the best attribute, then go to each branch and repeat it for the rest of the attributes. After building this tree, you can use it to predict the class of unknown cases.\n",

We're looking for the best feature to decrease the impurity, after splitting them up based on that feature. A node in the tree is considered pure if in 100 percent of the cases, the nodes fall into a specific category of the target field. In fact, the method uses recursive partitioning to split the training records into segments by minimizing the impurity at each step. Impurity of nodes is calculated by entropy of data in the node. \n",
    " Entropy is the amount of information disorder or the amount of randomness in the data. The entropy in the node depends on how much random data is in that node and is calculated for each node. In decision trees, we're looking for trees that have the smallest entropy in their nodes.  \n",

Information gain is the information that can increase the level of certainty after splitting. It is the entropy of a tree before the split minus the weighted entropy after the split by an attribute. We can think of information gain and entropy as opposites. As entropy or the amount of randomness decreases, the information gain or amount of certainty increases and vice versa. So, constructing a decision tree is all about finding attributes that return the highest information gain.\n",

    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic regression is analogous to linear regression but tries to predict a categorical or discrete target field instead of a numeric one. In linear regression, we might try to predict a continuous value of variables\n",
    "In logistic regression, we predict a variable which is binary such as yes/no, true/false, successful or not successful, pregnant/not pregnant, and so on, all of which can be coded as zero or one. In logistic regression dependent variables should be continuous. If categorical, they should be dummy or indicator coded. This means we have to transform them to some continuous value.\n",

    "1.  First, when the target field in your data is categorical or specifically is binary. Such as zero/one, yes/no, churn or no churn, positive/negative and so on. \n",
    "2. Second, you need the probability of your prediction. For example, if you want to know what the probability is of a customer buying a product. Logistic regression returns a probability score between zero and one for a given sample of data. In fact, logistic regression predicts the probability of that sample and we map the cases to a discrete class based on that probability. \n",
    "3. Third, if your data is linearly separable. The decision boundary of logistic regression is a line or a plane or a hyper plane. A classifier will classify all the points on one side of the decision boundary as belonging to one class and all those on the other side as belonging to the other class.\n",
    "4. Fourth, you need to understand the impact of a feature. You can select the best features based on the statistical significance of the logistic regression model coefficients or parameters. That is, after finding the optimum parameters, a feature X with the weight Theta one close to zero has a smaller effect on the prediction than features with large absolute values of Theta one. Indeed, it allows us to understand the impact an independent variable has on the dependent variable while controlling other independent variables.\n",

    "### Content-based Recommender Systems\n",
    "A Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items to users based on their profile. The user's profile revolves around that user's preferences and tastes. Similarity or closeness of items is measured based on the similarity in the content of those items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages and Disadvantages of Content-Based Filtering  \n",
    "**Advantages**  \n",
    "* Learns user's preferences\n",
    "* Highly personalized for the user\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "* Doesn't take into account what others think of the item, so low quality item recommendations might happen\n",
    "* Extracting data is not always intuitive\n",
    "* Determining what characteristics of the item the user dislikes or likes is not always obvious\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='colfil'></a>\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is based on the fact that relationships exist between products and people's interests. Many recommendation systems use collaborative filtering to find these relationships and to give an accurate recommendation of a product that the user might like or be interested in. Collaborative filtering has basically two approaches: user-based and item-based\n",
    "\n",
    "* User-based collaborative filtering is based on the user similarity or neighborhood. Collaborative filtering basis this similarity on things like history, preference, and choices that users make when buying, watching, or enjoying something.\n",
    "* Item-based collaborative filtering is based on similarity among items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challanges:\n",
    "1. **Data sparsity** happens when you have a large data set of users who generally rate only a limited number of items. As mentioned, collaborative based recommenders can only predict scoring of an item if there are other users who have rated it. Due to sparsity, we might not have enough ratings in the user item dataset which makes it impossible to provide proper recommendations. \n",
    "2. **Cold start** refers to the difficulty the recommendation system has when there is a new user, and as such a profile doesn't exist for them yet. Cold start can also happen when we have a new item which has not received a rating. \n",
    "3. **Scalability** can become an issue as well. As the number of users or items increases and the amount of data expands, collaborative filtering algorithms will begin to suffer drops in performance, simply due to growth and the similarity computation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "* Takes other user's ratings into consideration\n",
    "* Doesn't need to study or extract information from the recommended item\n",
    "* Adapts to the user's interests which might change over time\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "* Approximation function can be slow\n",
    "* There might be a low of amount of users to approximate\n",
    "* Privacy issues when trying to learn the user's preferences\n",
