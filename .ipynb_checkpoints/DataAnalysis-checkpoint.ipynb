    "### Understanding Data\n",
    "#### Python Packages\n",
    "A Python library is a collection of functions and methods that allow you to perform lots of actions without writing any code. The libraries usually contain built in modules providing different functionalities which you can use directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "And there are extensive libraries offering a broad range of facilities. We have divided the Python data analysis libraries into three groups. \n",
    "1. <b>Scientific computing libraries</b>\n",
    "     1.1 <b>Pandas</b> \n",
    "         * offers data structure and tools for effective data manipulation and analysis. \n",
    "         * It provides facts, access to structured data.\n",
    "         * The primary instrument of Pandas is the two dimensional table consisting of column and row labels, which are called a data frame. \n",
    "         * It is designed to provided easy indexing functionality. \n",
    "     1.2 The <b>NumPy</b> library \n",
    "         * uses arrays for its inputs and outputs. \n",
    "         * can be extended to objects for matrices and \n",
    "         * with minor coding changes, developers can perform fast array processing. \n",
    "     1.3 <b>SciPy</b> includes \n",
    "         * functions for some advanced math problems such as: Integrals, differential equations and optimisations\n",
    "         * data visualization  \n",
    "2. <b>Data visualization libraries</B>\n",
    "    These libraries enable you to create graphs, charts and maps. \n",
    "    2.1 </b>Matplotlib package</b> \n",
    "        * is the most well known library for data visualization. \n",
    "        * It is great for making graphs and plots. \n",
    "        * The graphs are customizable. \n",
    "    2.2 <b>Seaborn</b>\n",
    "        * Is based on Matplotlib\n",
    "        * Easy to generate various plots such as heat maps, time series and violin plots.\n",
    "3. <b>Algorithmic libraries</b>\n",
    "    The algorithmic libraries tackles the machine learning tasks from basic to complex. \n",
    "    3.1 <b>Scikit-learn library</b> contains tools statistical modeling, including regression, classification, clustering, and so on. This library is built on NumPy, SciPy and Matplotib.\n",
    "    3.2 <b>Statsmodels</b> is a Python module that allows users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing and Exporting Data in Python\n",
    "<b>Data acquisition</b> is a process of loading and reading data into notebook from various sources. To read any data using Python's pandas package, there are two important factors to consider, <b>format and file path</b>. \n",
    "* <b>Format</b> is the way data is encoded. Some common encodings are: CSV, JSON, XLSX, HDF ...\n",
    "* <b>Path</b> tells us where the data is stored  \n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, the <b>read_CSV method</b> can read in files with columns separated by commas into a pandas data frame. \n",
    "1. import pandas \n",
    "2. define a variable with a file path\n",
    "3. use the read_ CSV method to import the data\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading the dataset, it is a good idea to look at the data frame to get a better intuition and to ensure that everything occurred the way you expected. \n",
    "* df prints the entire dataset \n",
    "* df.head(n) shows the first n rows of the data frame. \n",
    "* df.tail(n)shows the bottom end rows of data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start analysing Data in Python\n",
    "Pandas has several built-in methods that can be used to understand the datatype or features or to look at the distribution of data within the dataset. Using these methods, gives an overview of the dataset and also point out potential issues such as the wrong data type of features which may need to be resolved later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data has a variety of types. The main types stored in Pandas' objects are \n",
    "* object, \n",
    "* float, \n",
    "* Int, \n",
    "* datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical metrics can tell the data scientist if there are mathematical issues that may exist such as extreme outliers and large deviations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the quick statistics, we use the describe method (<b>df.describe(inlcude=\"all\")</b>). It returns the number of terms in the column as \n",
    "* count, \n",
    "* average \n",
    "* mean\n",
    "* standard deviation\n",
    "* maximum \n",
    "* minimum\n",
    "* boundary of each of the quartiles\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the dataframe.describe functions skips rows and columns that do not contain numbers. It is possible to make the describe method worked for object type columns as well. To enable a summary of all the columns, we could add an argument. Include equals all inside the describe function bracket. \n",
    "\n",
    "A different set of statistics is evaluated, like \n",
    "* unique, \n",
    "* top, \n",
    "* frequency  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Databases with Python\n",
    "The Python code connects to the database using API calls (application programming interface), which is a set of functions that you can call to get access to some type of servers.  \n",
    "The two main concepts in the Python DB-API are <b>connection and query objects</b>. \n",
    "* You use connection objects to connect to a database and manage your transactions. \n",
    "* Cursor objects are used to run queries. You open a cursor object and then run queries. \n",

    "# Pre-processing Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the process of converting or mapping data from one raw form into another format to make it ready for further analysis. Data preprocessing is often called data cleaning or data wrangling.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. identify and handle missing values. \n",
    "2. data formats, standardize the values into the same format, or unit, or convention \n",
    "3. data normalization (centering and scaling\n",
    "4. Data Binning\n",
    "5. Turning categorical values into numeric variables to make statistical modeling easier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with missing values\n",
    "Usually missing value in data set appears as question mark and a zero or just a blank cell.\n",
    "Strategies:\n",
    "* check if the person or group that collected the data can go back and find what the actual value is\n",
    "* Drop the missing value\n",
    "    * drop the variable\n",
    "    * drop the data entry\n",
    "* Replace the missing value\n",

    "    * replace it by frequency\n",
    "    * repalce it based on other functions\n",
    "* Leave it as missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove data that contains missing values Panda's library has a built-in method called df.dropna(). You'll need to specify axis=0 to drop the <b>rows</b> or axis=1 to drop the <b>columns</b> that contain the missing values. To modify the dataframe, you have to set the parameter inplace=True.\n",
    "\n",
    "To replace missing values like NaNs with actual values, Pandas library has a built-in method called replace \"dataframe.replace(missing_value, new_value)\" which can be used to fill in the missing values with the newly calculated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data formating in Python\n",
    "Data formatting means bringing data into a common standard of expression that allows users to make meaningful comparisons. As a part of dataset cleaning, data formatting ensures the data is consistent and easily understandable.\n",
    "* Convert data -> df[\"city-mpg\"]= 235/df[\"city-mpg\"] plus rename column name df.rename(columns={\"city_mpg: \"city-L/100km\"}, inplace=True)\n",
    "* Convert data type -> df[\"price\"]=df[\"price\"].astype(\"int\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data normalisation\n",
    "By making the ranges consistent between variables, normalization enables a fair comparison between the different features, making sure they have the same impact.This normalization can make some statistical analyses easier down the road. By making the ranges consistent between variables, normalization enables a fair comparison between the different features, making sure they have the same impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three techniques to nomralise value\n",
    "1. <b>Simple feature scaling</b> just divides each value by the maximum value for that feature:  \n",
    "    df[\"length\"] = df[\"length\"]/df[\"length\"].max \n",
    "2. <b>min-max</b> takes each value X_old subtract it from the minimum value of that feature, then divides by the range of that feature:  \n",
    "    df[\"length\"] = (df[\"length\"]-df[\"length\"].min())/(df[\"length\"].max-df[\"length\"].min())\n",
    "3. <b>z-score or standard score</b>. In this formula for each value you subtract the $\\mu$ which is the average of the feature, and then divide by the standard deviation $\\sigma$ sigma. The resulting values hover around zero:  \n",
    "    df[\"length\"] = (df[\"length\"]-df[\"length\"].mean())/df[\"length\"].std()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binning in Python\n",
    "Binning is when you group values together into bins. Binning can improve accuracy of the predictive models. In addition, sometimes we use data binning to group a set of numerical values into a smaller number of bins to have a better understanding of the data distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we can easily implement the binning: We would like 3 bins of equal binwidth, so we need 4 numbers as dividers that are equal distance apart. \n",
    "1. First we use the numpy function “linspace” to return the array “bins” that contains 4 equally spaced numbers over the specified interval of the price:  \n",
    "bins=np.linspace(min(df[\"price\"]),max(df[\"price\"]),4)\n",
    "2. We create a list “group_names “ that contains the different bin names:  \n",
    "group_name=[\"Low\",\"Medium\",\"High\"]\n",
    "3. We use the pandas function ”cut” to segment and sort the data values into bins. You can then use histograms to visualize the distribution of the data after they’ve been divided into bins:  \n",
    "df[\"price-binned\"] = pd.cut(df[price],bins,lables=group_names,include_lowest=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turning categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python\n",
    "Most statistical models cannot take in objects or strings as input and for model training only take the numbers as inputs. We encode the values by adding new features corresponding to each unique element in the original feature we would like to encode. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Pandas, we can use get_dummies method to convert categorical variables to dummy variables. In Python, transforming categorical variables to dummy variables is simple. The get_dummies method automatically generates a list of numbers, each one corresponding to a particular category of the variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "pd.get_dummies(df['fuel'])\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exercise</b>\n",

    "Usually, the more variables you have, the better your model is at predicting, but this is not always true. Sometimes you may not have enough data, you may run into numerical problems, or many of the variables may not be useful and or even act as noise. As a result, you should always check the MSE and R^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to be able to compare the results of the MLR vs SLR models, we look at a combination of both the R-squared and MSE to make the best conclusion about the fit of the model.\n",

    "R-squared: In this case, we can also see that there is a big difference between the R-squared of the SLR and the R-squared of the MLR. The R-squared for the SLR (~0.497) is very small compared to the R-squared for the MLR (~0.809).\n",

    "# Model Evaluation\n",
    "Model evaluation tells us how our model performs in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separating data into training and testing sets is an important part of model evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use training set to build a model and discover predictive relationships. We then use a testing set to evaluate model performance. When we have completed testing our model, we should use all the data to train the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "A popular function, in the scikit-learn package for splitting datasets, is the train test split function. This function randomly splits a dataset into training and testing subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "imported from sklearn.cross-validation. The input parameters y_data is the target variable. In the car appraisal example, it would be the price and x_data, the list of predictive variables. In this case, it would be all the other variables in the car dataset that we are using to try to predict the price. The output is an array. x_train and y_train the subsets for training. x_test and y_test the subsets for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "cross-validation. One of the most common out of sample evaluation metrics is cross-validation. In this method, the dataset is split into K equal groups. Each group is referred to as a fold. For example, four folds. Some of the folds can be used as a training set which we use to train the model and the remaining parts are used as a test set, which we use to test the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "The goal of Model Selection is to determine the order of the polynomial to provide the best estimate of the function y(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Underfitting: where the model is too simple to fit the data. \n",

    "plot of the mean square error for the training and testing set of different order polynomials. The horizontal axis represents the order of the polynomial. The vertical axis is the mean square error. The training error decreases with the order of the polynomial. The test error is a better means of estimating the error of a polynomial. The error decreases 'til the best order of the polynomial is determined. Then the error begins to increase. We select the order that minimizes the test error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ridge Regression\n",
    "Ridge regression prevents overfitting. We will focus on polynomial regression for visualization, but overfitting is also a big problem when you have multiple independent variables, or features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression controls the magnitude of these polynomial coefficients by introducing the parameter alpha. Alpha is a parameter we select before fitting or training the model. Each row in the following table represents an increasing value of alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction using ridge regression, import ridge from sklearn.linear_models. Create a ridge object using the constructor. The parameter alpha is one of the arguments of the constructor. We train the model using the fit method. To make a prediction, we use the predict method. In order to determine the parameter alpha, we use some data for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gride Search\n",
    "Scikit-learn has a means of automatically iterating over these hyperparameters using cross-validation. This method is called Grid Search. Grid Search takes the model or objects you would like to train and different values of the hyperparameters. It then calculates the mean square error or R-squared for various hyperparameter values, allowing you to choose the best values.\n",
