    "There are several types of information models. \n",
    "* <b>Hierarchical model</b> typically used to show organization charts. The root of the tree is the parent node followed by child nodes. A child node cannot have more than one parent. However, a parent can have many child nodes\n",
    "* <b>Relational model</b> is the most used data model for databases, because this model allows for data independence. Data is stored in simple data structure tables\n",

    "\n",
    "A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. It is a collection of items of the same type. It would have no order and no duplicates. A relational database is a set of relations. A relation is also the mathematical term for a table.\n",

    "A relational schema specifies the name of a relation and the attributes. A relational instance is a table made up of the attributes or columns and the tuples or rows. The columns are the attributes or fields. The rows are tuples. Degree refers the number of attributes or columns in a relation. Cardinality refers to the number of tuples or rows.\n",

    "This section gives more detailed explanation about concepts that were not covered in the videos in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Create Schema</b>\n",
    "A SQL schema is identified by a schema name, and includes a authorization identifier to indicate the user or account who owns the schema. Schema elements include tables, constraints, views, domains and other constructs that describe the schema.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A schema is created using the CREATE SCHEMA statement. For example, we can create a schema called LIBRARY for this course:  \n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE SCHEMA LIBRARY AUTHORIZATION ‘Robert’  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data types used can be: numeric, character-string, bit-string, Boolean, DATE, timestamp, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>CREATE TABLE Statement</b>  \n",
    "The CREATE TABLE statement includes these clauses:  \n",
    "\n",
    "· DEFAULT  \n",
    "\n",
    "· CHECK  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the DEFAULT clause in the CREATE TABLE statement to specify the default value for the database server to insert into a column when no explicit value for the column is specified.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the CHECK clause to designate conditions that must be met before data can be assigned to a column during an INSERT or UPDATE statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "During an insert or update, if the check constraint of a row evaluates to false, the database server returns an error. The database server does not return an error if a row evaluates to NULL for a check constraint. In some cases, you might want to use both a check constraint and a NOT NULL constraint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>SELECT Statement</b>\n",
    "The basic structure of the SELECT statement is formed from three clauses: SELECT, FROM and WHERE.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by the query  \n",
    "\n",
    "<table list> is a list of the relation names required to process the query  \n",
    "\n",
    "<condition> is a conditional(Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples to be retrieved by the query  \n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where you might want to use multiple IF-THEN-ELSE statements, you can often use a single SELECT statement instead. The SELECT statement allows a CLIST to select actions from a list of possible actions. An action consists of one or more statements or commands. The SELECT statement has the following syntax, ending with the END statement. You can use the SELECT statement with or without the initial test expression.  \n",

    "### Simplify by using String Patterns, Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of a database management system is not just to store the data, but also facilitate retrieval of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WHERE clause always requires a predicate, which is a condition that evaluates to true, false or unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement can be simplified by using string patterns, ranges or sets of values:\n",
    "* The <b>like [=]</b> predicate is used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column\n",
    "* The <b>percent [%]</b> sign is used to define missing letters. It can be placed before the pattern, after the pattern, or both before and after the pattern. The percent sign is called a wildcard character. A wildcard character is used to substitute other characters.\n",
    "* The N operator allows us to specify a set of values in a WHERE clause. This operator takes a list of expressions to compare against.\n",

    "* A primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each row in a table. A table containing a primary key that is related to at least one foreign key is called a parent table\n",
    "* A foreign key is a set of columns referring to a primary key of another table. A table containing one or more foreign keys is called a dependent table (child table)\n",
    "\n",
    "Six constraints in relational data base model:\n",
    "1. entity integrity constraint:   \n",
    "    To identify each topple in a relation, the relation must have a primary key. The primary key is a unique value that identifies each topple or row in a table. This is the entity integrity constraint (primary and key constraint or unique constraint). The entity integrity constraint states that no attribute participating in the primary key of a relation is allowed to accept null values.\n",
    "2. referential integrity constraint:  \n",
    "    Referential integrity constraint defines relationships between tables and ensures that these relationships remain valid. The validity of the data is enforced using a combination of primary keys and foreign keys.\n",
    "3. semantic integrity constraint:  \n",
    "    The semantic integrity constraint refers to the correctness of the meaning of the data.\n",
    "4. domain constraint:  \n",

    "    The check constraint enforces domain integrity by limiting the values that are accepted by an attribute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Primary Keys\n",
    "If a relation schema has more than one key, then each key is called a candidate key. One of the candidate keys is designated as the primary key, and the others are called secondary keys. In a practical relational database, each relation schema must have a primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for primary keys:\n",
    "* The value of the Primary Key must be unique for each instance of the entity.\n",
    "* There can be no missing values (i.e. Not Null) for Primary Keys. If the Primary Key is composed of multiple attributes, each of those attributes must have a value for each instance\n",
    "* The Primary Key is immutable, that is, once created the value of the Primary Key cannot be changed.\n",
    "* If the Primary Key consists of multiple attributes, none of these values can be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Integrity\n",
    "Semantic integrity ensures that data entered into a row reflects an allowable value for that row. The value must be within the domain, or allowable set of values, for that column. If a value outside the domain can be entered into a column, the semantic integrity of the data is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semantic Constraints\n",
    "Semantic Constraints are constraints that cannot be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model. Semantic constraints are also called application-based rules or business rules. They are additional rules specified by users or database administrators. For example, a class can have a maximum of 30 students; salary of an employee cannot exceed the salary of the employee’s manager.\n",

    "# Accessing databases using Python\n",
    "The Python ecosystem is very rich and provides easy to use tools for data science. Some of the most popular packages are NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and SciPy. \n",
    "* Python is easy to learn and has a simple syntax. \n",
    "* Due to its open source nature, Python has been ported to many platforms. \n",
    "* All your python programs can work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes at all. \n",
    "* Python supports relational database systems. Writing Python code to access databases is made easier by the presence of the Python database API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook interface is a virtual notebook environment used for programming. Examples of notebook interfaces include the \n",
    "* mathematical notebook, \n",

    "* matlab notebook, \n",
    "* IPython Jupyter, \n",
    "* R Markdown, \n",

    "Here are some of the advantages of using <b>Jupyter notebooks</b>. \n",
    "* Notebook support for over 40 programming languages including Python, R, Julia, and Scala. \n",
    "* Notebooks can be shared with others by email, Dropbox, GitHub, and the Jupyter notebook viewer. \n",
    "* Your code can produce rich interactive output HTML, images, videos lay tech, and customized types. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Writing code using DB-API\n",
    "The Python code connects to the database using DB-API calls. DB-API is Python's standard API for accessing relational databases. It is a standard that allows you to write a single program that works with multiple kinds of relational databases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of using the DB-API\n",
    "* It's easy to implement and understand. \n",
    "* This API has been defined to encourage similarity between the Python modules that are used to access databases. \n",
    "* It achieves consistency which leads to more easily understood modules. \n",
    "* The code is generally more portable across databases, and it has a broader reach of database connectivity from Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two main concepts in the Python DB-API are <b>connection objects</b> and <b>query objects</b>. You use connection objects to connect to a database and manage your transactions. Cursor objects are used to run queries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Curser methods:</b>  \n",
    "* cursor(): method returns a new cursor object using the connection\n",
    "* commit(): method is used to commit any pending transaction to the database\n",
    "* rollback(): method causes the database to roll back to the start of any pending transaction \n",
    "* close(): method is used to close a database connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Walk through a Python application that uses the DB-API to query a database. \n",
    "1. First, you import your database module by using the connect API from that module. \n",
    "2. To open a connection to the database, you use the connection function and pass in the parameters that is the database name, username, and password. \n",
    "3. The connect function returns connection object. \n",
    "4. After this, you create a cursor object on the connection object. The cursor is used to run queries and fetch results. \n",
    "5. After running the queries using the cursor, we also use the cursor to fetch the results of the query. \n",
    "6. Finally, when the system is done running the queries, it frees all resources by closing the connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connecting to a database using ibm_db API\n",
    "The ibm_db API provides a variety of useful Python functions for accessing and manipulating data in an IBM data server database, including functions for \n",
    "* connecting to a database, \n",
    "* preparing and issuing sequel statements, \n",
    "* fetching rows from result sets, \n",
    "* calling stored procedures, \n",
    "* committing and rolling back transactions, \n",
    "* handling errors and \n",
    "* retrieving metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting to the DB2 warehouse requires the following information: \n",
    "* a driver name, \n",
    "* a database name, \n",
    "* a host DNS name or IP address, \n",
    "* a host port, \n",
    "* a connection protocol, \n",
    "* a user ID, \n",
    "* a user password\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python  \n",
    "1. Import the ibm_db library into the Python application\n",
    "2. Create a connection object DSN, which stores the connection credentials.\n",
    "3. Connecting to dashDB or DB2 database requires the following information:\n",

    "* A left join matches the results from two tables and displays all the rows from the left table, and combines the information with rows from the right table that match the criteria specified in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Right Outer Join\n",
    "A right join matches the results from two tables and displays all the rows from the right table and combines the information with rows from the left table that matched the criteria specified in the query.\n",
    "The result set of a right join is all rows from both tables matching the criteria specified in the query plus all non-matching rows from the right table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In an outer join, the first table specified in the from clause of the SQL statement is referred to as the left table and the remaining table is referred to as the right table. This is the syntax that the select statement for our right join.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Outer Join\n",
    "The full join keyword returns all rows from both tables. That is all rows from the left table and all rows from the right table.\n",

    "1. If you're loading the data into the database using the visual load tool in the database console, ensure the header in first row is enabled. This will map the attribute names in the first row of the CSV file into column names in the database table, and the rest of the rows into the data rows in the table.\n",
    "2. SELECT <b>id</b> runs into an error because the database parser assumes <b>uppercase names</b> by default\n",
    "3. In this case, to select data from a column with a mixed case name e.g. \"Id\", we need to specify the column name in its correct case within double quotes as follows. Select <b>* \"Id\"</b>\n",
    "4. In a CSV file if the name of the column contain spaces, by default the database may map them to underscores\n",
    "5. Other special characters like parentheses or brackets may also get mapped to underscores.\n",
    "6. When using quotes in Jupyter notebooks, you may be issuing queries in a notebook by first assigning them to Python variables. In such cases if your query contains double quotes for example, to specify a mixed case column name, you could differentiate the quotes by using single quotes for the Python variable to enclose this SQL query and double quotes for the column names. For example, selectQuery ='select \"Id\" from dogs.' \n",
