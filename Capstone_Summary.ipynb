    "## Introduction to Foursquare\n",
    "Start learning about Foursquare and how their data looks like. So let's get started. As a brief introduction for those who are still not very clear about Foursquare, Foursquare is a technology company that built a massive dataset of location data. What is interesting about Foursquare is that they were very smart about building their dataset. They actually crowd-sourced their data and had people use their app to build their dataset and add venues and complete any missing information they had in their dataset. Currently its location data is the most comprehensive out there, and quite accurate that it powers location data for many popular services \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a city like the City of Toronto, you will segment it into different neighborhoods using the geographical coordinates of the center of each neighborhood, and then using a combination of location data and machine learning, you will group the neighbourhoods into clusters \n",
    "\n",
    "**Location Data:**\n",
    "Location data is data describing places and venues, such as their geographical location, their category, working hours, full address, and so on, such that for a given location given in the form of its geographical coordinates (or latitude and longitude values) one is able to determine what types of venues exist within a defined radius from that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the many location data providers are \n",
    "* Foursquare, \n",
    "* Google Places, \n",
    "* Yelp\n",
    "\n",
    "Location data providers will differ in a number of features. \n",
    "* rate limits for example is one of them, which essentially means how many API calls you can make in a defined time frame such as calls per hour or calls per day. \n",
    "* cost, which is how much it would cost you to use their API to fetch location data. \n",
    "* coverage, which is geospatial coverage. In other words, how many countries or geographical locations the location data set covers. \n",
    "* accuracy, so how accurate is the location data provided by each provider\n",
    "* etc\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **Foursquare** location dataset as their dataset is most comprehensive. Also creating a developer account to use their API is quite straightforward and the easiest compared to other providers. Therefore, let's start learning how to use the Foursquare API to leverage location data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Home](home)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foursquare Search\n",
    "Communicating with the Foursquare database is really very easy, all thanks to their **RESTful API**. You simply create a uniform resource identifier, or URI, and you append it with extra parameters depending on the data that you are seeking from the database. Any call request you make is composed of, we can call this base URI, which is api.foursquare.com/v2, and you can request data about venues, users, or tips.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you make a call request, you have to pass your developer account credentials, which are your Client ID and Client Secret as well as what is called the version of the API, which is simply a date. It is designed to give developers the freedom to adapt to Foursquare API changes on their own schedule. In other words, you request the data to be returned to you in the format that was the latest up to the date defined by the version.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the call to the database, and in return we get a JSON file that match our query. Remember, this is a regular call and with a personal developer account, we can make up to 99,500 similar calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only get **two tips and photos per venue** and not the entire list of tips. And remember, that this type of call is premium so with a personal account we **can only make 500** similar calls per day.\n",

    "## Neighborhood Segmentation and Clustering\n",
    "Learn about k-means clustering, which is a form of unsupervised learning. Then you will use clustering and the Foursquare API to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of New York. Furthermore, you will learn how to scrape website and parse HTML code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "K-means can group data only unsupervised based on the similarity of customers to each other. There are various types of clustering algorithms such as partitioning, hierarchical, or density based clustering. K-means is a type of partitioning clustering. That is, it divides the data into k non-overlapping subsets or clusters without any cluster internal structure or labels. This means, it's an unsupervised algorithm. \n",
    "Objects within a cluster are very similar, and objects across different clusters are very different or dissimilar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance of samples from each other is used to shape the clusters. So, we can say, K-means tries to minimize the intra-cluster distances and maximize the inter-cluster distances. We can easily use a specific type of Minkowski distance to calculate the distance of these two customers. Indeed, it is the euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can still use the same formula but this time in a two-dimensional space. Also we can use the same distance matrix for multidimensional vectors. Of course, we have to normalize our feature set to get the accurate dissimilarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept of the K-means algorithm is that, it randomly picks a center point for each cluster. It means, we must initialize k which represents number of clusters. centroids of clusters and should be of same feature size of our customer feature set. After the initialization step, which was defining the centroid of each cluster, we have to assign each customer to the closest center. For this purpose, we have to calculate the distance of each data point or in our case each customer from the centroid points\n",
    "\n",
    "form a matrix where each row represents the distance of a customer from each centroid. It is called the distance matrix. The main objective of K-means clustering is to minimize the distance of data points from the centroid of it's cluster and maximize the distance from other cluster centroids. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error is the total distance of each point from its centroid. It can be shown as within-cluster sum of squares error. Intuitively, we try to reduce this error. It means we should shape clusters in such a way that the total distance of all members of a cluster from its centroid be minimized. Once again, we will have to calculate the distance of all points from the new centroids. The points are re-clustered and the centroids move again. This continues until the centroids no longer move. Please note that whenever a centroid moves, each points distance to the centroid needs to be measured again. Yes, K-means is an iterative algorithm, and we have to repeat steps two to four until the algorithm converges. There is no guarantee that it will converge to the global optimum, and the result may depend on the initial clusters\n",
