    "what you are try to do in an experiment in the day to day generated process is that you have the systematic variation and nothing else, but that systematic piece variable. They are often smaller in scale and they're specifically designed to answer that particular research question. What's the effect of x on y? X being the treatment, y being my outcome.\n",

    "Features of what we call big data:  \n",
    "1. Volume: For one, they will provide large volume. \n",
    "2. Velocity: Second feature is the velocity. They come in at a high frequency, and that creates an additional analytical challenge.\n",
    "3. Variety: They also come in a wide variety, so here we have timestamps, we have geo coordinates, we have motion measures, and if you think of the big data space in general you can think of even more variety, pictures, sounds, anything can be turned into data.  \n",
    "4. Veracity: The data are also erroneous, or they can be. You might be doubtful about certain elements here in your dataset. You might be missing entire pieces.\n",

    "### The AAPOR Report\n",
    "The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) is a professional\n",
    "organization dedicated to advancing the study of “public opinion,” broadly defined, to include\n",
    "attitudes, norms, values, and behaviors.  \n",
    "**Recommendations of the report:**  \n",
    "1. Surveys and Big Data are complementary data sources not competing data sources. There are differences between the approaches, but this should be seen as an advantage rather than a disadvantage. \n",
    "2. AAPOR should develop standards for the use of Big Data in survey research when more knowledge has been accumulated. \n",
    "3. AAPOR should start working with the private sector and other professional organizations to educate its members on Big Data\n",
    "4. AAPOR should inform the public of the risks and benefits of Big Data. \n",
    "5. AAPOR should help remove the barrier associated with different uses of terminology.\n",
    "6. AAPOR should take a leading role in working with federal agencies in developing a necessary infrastructure for the use of Big Data in survey research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big Data characteristics**\n",
    "* **Volume:**\n",
    "This refers to the sheer amount of data available for analysis. This volume of data is driven by the increasing number of data collection instruments (e.g., social media tools, mobile applications, sensors) as well as the increased ability to store and transfer those data with recent improvements in data storage and networking.\n",
    "* **Velocity:**\n",
    "This refers to both the speed at which these data collection events can occur, and the pressure of managing large streams of real-time data. Across the means of collecting social information, new information is being added to the database at rates ranging from as slow as every hour or so, to as fast as thousands of events per second.\n",
    "* **Variety:**\n",
    "This refers to the complexity of formats in which Big Data can exist. Besides structured databases, there are large streams of unstructured documents, images, email messages, video, links between devices and other forms that create a heterogeneous set of data points. One effect of this complexity is that structuring and tying data together becomes a major effort, and therefore a central concern of Big Data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic statistical paradigm was one in which researchers formulated a hypothesis, identified a population frame, designed a survey and a sampling technique and then analyzed the results. The new paradigm means it is now possible to digitally capture, semantically\n",
    "reconcile, aggregate, and correlate data. These correlations might be effective (Halevy et al. 11 2009, Cukier and Mayer-Schoenberger 2013) or suspect (Couper 2013), but they enable completely new analyses to be undertaken – many of which would not be possible using\n",
    "survey data alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Bid Data matters**  \n",
    "Recent work shows data driven businesses were 5% more productive and 6% more profitable than their competitors (Brynjolfsson et al. 2011, McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2012). Using data with high volume, velocity, and variety, public opinion researchers can potentially increase the scope of their data collection efforts while at the same time reducing costs, increasing timeliness, and increasing precision (Murphy et al. 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if data collection is cheap, the costs of cleaning, curating, standardizing, integrating and using the new types of data can be\n",
    "substantial (see Section 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sources:\n",
    "What do you want to know, thinking about that data generating process, who's part of it? What is the measurement? Why were the data generated? What is missing? What is not said? All these possible sources that might prevent this from making valid inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paradata:  \n",
    "The process of collecting survey data actually generates also processed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Home](#home)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='cura'></a>\n",
    "## Data Curation, Storage and Analysis\n",
    "Editing happens everywhere. And the same is of course true with the data that we deal with. There might be, Editing as part of this curation step in the big data process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the technique, how you do the sample, that distribution can either be wider, or more narrow than the population distribution. It can also be biased, the center being away from the true center.  you need to capture variability correctly in order to provide your estimate of a percentage, the mean or total, or even to talk about the size of a treatment effect or the precision of a prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Access\n",
    "So much data is publicly available and can be used for the public good. But of course, there are privacy issues and challenging ones that we haven't solved yet. \n",
    "* tension between privacy on the one hand and public goods \n",
    "* Between the convenience versus private companies knowing everything about me\n",
    "* tension that privacy is no longer guaranteed\n",
    "* attention between informed consent, asking people whether they are willing, and purposefully providing the data\n",
    "* tension between privacy and data quality, maybe knowing that these data will be collected, people start misreporting, age for example would be an easy one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Resources\n",
    "What is interesting is that increasingly federal agency and national institutes that collect data, make these data available for researchers in their own country or across the world.\n",
    "* Data Archives in the U.S., ICPSR is a very large one for the social sciences\n",
    "* Data.gov\n",
    "* eurostat\n",
    "* Data without Boundary"
