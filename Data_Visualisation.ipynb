    "Data visualization is a way to show a complex data in a form that is graphical and easy to understand. This can be especially useful when one is trying to explore the data and getting acquainted with it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice:\n",
    "* less is more effective, \n",
    "* it is more attractive, \n",

    "### Introduction to Matplotlib\n",
    "Matplotlib is one of the most widely used, if not the most popular data visualization library in Python. It was created by John Hunter, who was a neurobiologist and was part of a research team that was working on analyzing Electrocorticography signals, ECoG for short.\n",
    "Matplotlib was equipped with a scripting interface for quick and easy generation of graphics, represented by pyplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib's architecture is composed of three main layers: \n",
    "1. <b>the Back-End layer</b> has three built-in abstract interface classes: \n",
    "    * FigureCanvas, which defines and encompasses the area on which the figure is drawn. \n",
    "    * Renderer, an instance of the renderer class knows how to draw on the figure canvas. \n",
    "    * Event, which handles user inputs such as keyboard strokes and mouse clicks    \n",
    "2. the <b>Artist Layer</b> where much of the heavy lifting happens and is usually the appropriate programming paradigm when writing a web application server, or a UI application, or perhaps a script to be shared with other developers. There are two types of Artist objects: \n",
    "    * The <b>primitive type</b>, such as a line, a rectangle, a circle, or text. \n",
    "    * The <b>composite type</b>, such as the figure or the axes.  \n",
    "    The top-level Matplotlib object that contains and manages all of the elements in a given graphic is the <b>figure artist</b>, and the most important composite artist is the <b>axes</b> because it is where most of the Matplotlib API plotting methods are defined, including methods to create and manipulate the ticks, the axis lines, the grid or the plot background. \n",
    "3. the <b>Scripting layer</b>, which is the appropriate layer for everyday purposes and is considered a lighter scripting interface to simplify common tasks and for a quick and easy generation of graphics and plots. Matplotlib's scripting layer is essentially the Matplotlib.pyplot interface, which automates the process of defining a canvas and defining a figure artist instance and connecting them.\n",

    "### Basic Plotting with Matplotlib\n",
    "We will be working mostly with the scripting interface. In other words, we will learn how to create almost all of the visualization tools using the scripting interface\n",
    "Limitations:  \n",
    "After rendering the figure, there is no way for us to add, for example, a figure title or label its axes. With the <b>% matplotlib notebook</b> backend in place, if a plt function is called, it checks if an active figure exists, and any functions you call will be applied to this active figure. If a figure does not exist, it renders a new figure.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pandas\n",
    "Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Plotting in pandas is as simple as calling the plot function on a given pandas series or dataframe. Fortunately, pandas has a built-in implementation of Matplotlib that we can use. Plotting in pandas is as simple as appending a .plot() method to a series or dataframe.\n",

    "### Line Plots\n",
    "A line chart or line plot is a type of plot which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments.

    "## Basic Visualisation Tools\n",
    "### Area plots\n",
    "An area plot also known as an area chart or graph is a type of plot that depicts accumulated totals using numbers or percentages over time. It is based on the line plot and is commonly used when trying to compare two or more quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "An <b>area chart</b> is really similar to a line chart, except that the area between the x axis and the line is filled in with color or shading. It represents the evolution of a numerical variable following another numerical variable. If you want to represent this evolution for several groups in the same time, you are probably interested by <b>stacked area chart</b>, where every groups are displayed one of top of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Histograms\n",
    "A histogram is a way of representing the frequency distribution of a numeric dataset. The way it works is it partitions the spread of the numeric data into bins, assigns each datapoint in the dataset to a bin, and then counts the number of datapoints that have been assigned to each bin. So the vertical axis is actually the <b>frequency or the number of datapoints in each bin</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bar Charts\n",
    "A bar chart is a very popular visualization tool. Unlike a histogram, a bar chart also known as a bar graph is a type of plot where the length of each bar is proportional to the value of the item that it represents. It is commonly used to compare the values of a variable at a given point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two types of plotting\n",
    "There are two styles/options of ploting with matplotlib. Plotting using the <b>Artist layer</b> and plotting using the <b>scripting layer</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Option 1: Scripting layer (procedural method) - using matplotlib.pyplot as 'plt':  \n",
    "    You can use plt i.e. matplotlib.pyplot and add more elements by calling different methods procedurally; for example, plt.title(...) to add title or plt.xlabel(...) to add label to the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Option 2: Artist layer (Object oriented method) - using an Axes instance from Matplotlib:  \n",
    "    You can use an Axes instance of your current plot and store it in a variable (eg. ax). You can add more elements by calling methods with a little change in syntax (by adding \"set_\" to the previous methods). For example, use ax.set_title() instead of plt.title() to add title, or ax.set_xlabel() instead of plt.xlabel() to add label to the x-axis.\n",

    "\n",
    "A scatter plot (2D) is a useful method of comparing variables against each other. Scatter plots look similar to line plots in that they both map independent and dependent variables on a 2D graph. While the datapoints are connected together by a line in a line plot, they are not connected in a scatter plot. The data in a scatter plot is considered to express a trend. With further analysis using tools like regression, we can mathematically calculate this relationship and use it to predict trends outside the dataset.\n",

    "### Waffle Chart\n",
    "A waffle chart is a great way to visualize data in relation to a whole or to highlight progress against a given threshold. The main idea here is for a given waffle chart whose desired height and width are defined, the contribution of each country is transformed into a number of tiles that is proportional to the country's contribution to the total, so that more the contribution the more the tiles, resulting in what resembles a waffle when combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "A waffle chart is an interesting visualization that is normally created to display progress toward goals. It is commonly an effective option when you are trying to add interesting visualization features to a visual that consists mainly of cells, such as an Excel dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word Clouds\n",
    "A word cloud is simply a depiction of the importance of different words in the body of text. A word cloud works in a simple way; the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data the bigger and bolder it appears in the world cloud. Assuming that we didn't know anything about the content of these documents, a word cloud can be very useful to assign a topic to some unknown textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, a Python package already exists in Python for generating word clouds. The package, called word_cloud was developed by **Andreas Mueller**. You can learn more about the package by following this [link](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seaborn and Regression\n",
    "Seaborn is another data visualization library, it is actually based on Matplotlib. It was built primarily to provide a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics, such as regression plots, box plots, and so on. Seaborn makes creating plots very efficient. Therefore with Seaborn you can generate plots with code that is 5 times less than with Matplotlib.\n",

    "## Visualising Geospatial Data\n",
    "### Introduction to Folium\n",
    "Folium is a powerful data visualization library in Python that was built primarily to help people visualize geospatial data. With Folium, you can create a map of any location in the world as long as you know its latitude and longitude values. \n",
    "You can also create a map and superimpose markers as well as clusters of markers on top of the map for cool and very interesting visualizations. You can also create maps of different styles such as street level map, stamen map, and a couple others which we will look into in just a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Styles**  \n",
    "You can create different map styles using the tiles parameter e.g.:  \n",
    "* **stamen toner map**, this style is great for visualizing and exploring river meanders and coastal zones. \n",
    "* **stamen terrain**, this style is great for visualizing hill shading and natural vegetation colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maps with Markers\n",
    "We continue working with the Folium library and learn how to superimpose markers on top of a map for interesting visualizations. To do that, we need to create what is called a feature group. Let's go ahead and create a feature group. When a feature group is created, it is empty and that means what's next is to start creating what is called children and adding them to the feature group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choropleth Maps\n",
    "A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per capita income.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a choropleth map of a region of interest, Folium requires a Geo JSON file that includes geospatial data of the region. For a choropleth map of the world, we would need a Geo JSON file that lists each country along with any geospatial data to define its borders and boundaries. Here is an example of what the Geo JSON file would include about each country.\n",
